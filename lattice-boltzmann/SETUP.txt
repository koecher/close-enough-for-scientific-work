Requirements
------------

- [Julia](http://julialang.org/): Science-oriented programming language
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): Shiny way to write code+comments.
- [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl): Shiny way to write code+comments with Julia.
- [LatBo.jl](https://github.com/UCL/LatBo.jl): Fluid-dynamics code that will be tested in this
  lesson
- [FactCheck.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/FactCheck.jl): Testing framework
- [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl): General Linear Models
- [DataFrame.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataFrames.jl): Data-structure specialised for
  statistics
- [Gadfly.jl](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl): One way to create graphs in Julia.

The programming language can be installed form its website, or from your Unix package manager (yum,
apt-get, Homebrew ...). The second and third items make up a software that we use to create a lesson
interlacing both text and code. `Jupyter` is also known as
[IPython](http://ipython.org) and can be installed as shown
[here](http://ipython.org/install.html). The `IJulia` component can be installed from _inside_ a
Julia prompt:

~~~Julia
Pkg.add("IJulia")
import IJulia
IJulia.notebook()
~~~

The first line will install `IJulia`. The second and third will run it in the current directory.
Make sure that directory contains this lesson!

Enjoy
